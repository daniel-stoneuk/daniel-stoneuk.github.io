I'm an advanced Android Developer with experience in RxJava, Retrofit and many new technologies. 


After developing <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.danielstone.energyhive">Monitor</a> I started looking into more advanced development techniques. Many apps, including [FastHub for GitHub][https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fastaccess.github], use [material-about-library][https://github.com/daniel-stoneuk/material-about-library] - my first Android Library. 

Get in touch today at [apps@daniel-stone.uk][mailto:apps@daniel-stone.uk].
