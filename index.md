I'm an advanced Android Developer with experience in RxJava, Retrofit and many new technologies. 


After developing <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.danielstone.energyhive">Monitor</a> I started looking into more advanced development techniques. Many apps, including <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fastaccess.github">FastHub for GitHub</a>, use <a href="https://github.com/daniel-stoneuk/material-about-library">material-about-library</a> - my first Android Library. 

Get in touch today at <a href="mailto:apps@daniel-stone.uk">apps@daniel-stone.uk</a>.
