GCSE revision is well underway - four and a half hours a day during the Easter break and then 1 and a half hours during the week up until study leave.

Unfortunately this means that I don't have ~~much time~~ any time to work on Android projects including Monitor. My last exam is on the 22nd of June, after that I will be able to finalise the major update coming to Monitor (contact me if you'd like to help me test it) that I'm really excited about. I'm sure it'll convert the 18 four star reviews into five star reviews ;)

Anyway, wish me luck! Not long now until it's all over :D
