## Hi there.
My name is Dan Stone, I'm 15 years old and I like programming (among other things). That's all you need to know about me for now. I am going to use this lovely new site to share my ideas and projects for a wide range of things - from my GCSE Computer Science course, to the hurdles I encounter when developing Android Apps.

I currently have an Android app on the Play Store - [Monitor for EnergyHive and Engage][monitor]. Quoting the description:

> Monitor is a native and lightweight unofficial client for the EnergyHive and Efergy Engage Internet of Things platforms, beautifully designed with material design.

Please do check it out if you have an [EnergyHive][energyhive] or [Efergy][efergy] hub.

Anyway, that's all from me for now. I'll catch you later as I have many ideas to write about. Keep checking for updates!

See ya,  
Dan
